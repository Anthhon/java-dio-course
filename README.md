# Java Dio Course

## Who am i?

My name is Anthony Carneiro da Silva, and I'm an 18-year-old developer. **I've always been passionate about computer and IT-related topics,**
and for the most part, I've been in love with the C programming language. I've also worked professionally with Python, Django, HTML, and CSS.
Recently, I've been eager to explore new technologies, which is what led me to discover the **Banco PAN Java Developer bootcamp**.

## What is this repository?

This repository is intended to serve as a comprehensive mirror for all the activities and challenges that I complete during the
**Banco PAN Java Developer bootcamp.** Whether I'm learning about the basics of Java programming, exploring the intricacies of
advanced data structures, or working on real-world projects, I plan to document each step of my journey in this repository.
By doing so, I can keep track of my own progress and also share my projects and solutions with others.
I'm excited to see where this bootcamp takes me, and I look forward to sharing my insights and achievements with the world.
